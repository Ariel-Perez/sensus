cats flies and women are ever at their toilets
the dog for the man the cat for the woman
thou art the great cat the avenger of the gods and the judge of words and the president of the sovereign chiefs and the governor of the holy circle thou art indeed the great cat
hello world
if a dog s prayers were answered bones would rain from the sky
if it were a dog it would have bitten you already
if you wish the dog to follow you feed him
many dogs kill a hare no matter how many turns it makes
one barking dog sets the street barking
the hindmost dog may catch the hare
why keep a dog and bark yourself
a dog has four feet but he can t walk four different paths
a dog in a kennel barks at his fleas a dog hunting does not notice them
a kitchen dog is never a good rabbit hunter
dog does not eat dog
give a dog a bad name and hang him
he who pelts every barking dog must pick up many stones
hold your dog in readiness before you start the hare
if a dog s prayers were answered bones would rain from the sky
if it were a dog it would have bitten you already
if you wish the dog to follow you feed him
many dogs kill a hare no matter how many turns it makes
one barking dog sets the street barking
the hindmost dog may catch the hare
why keep a dog and bark yourself
